The macros for chapter "Creating nanoparticles"
are organised into subdirctories.

The lines underneath the short description of the refinement topic give
the main macro that should be used to start the simulation and the macro
that should be used to display the simulation results.

The ZnSE simulation has been split into two parts, since both are part 
of the refinement of experimental data.
